# ESCAlab-NTNU
Analysis software for photoemission data recorded using the NanoESCA III from FOCUS GmbH. Code written for use with Igor Pro 7 or later.

Inspired by pre-existing NanoESCA code written by A. Locatelli. T. O. Mentes and G. Zamborlini, Elettra 2016.

ESCAlab is written and maintained by Håkon Røst, QuSpin, NTNU.

## Installation
1) Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2) Download, install and configure either [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Detailed information on how to do this can be found in the [GitHub Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart).
3) Once you have Git/GitHub Desktop set up, maneuver to the folder where you want to store the code locally on your computer.
4) Clone the repository to your local folder (in Git, this is done by executing **git clone https://github.com/Hkonrost/ESCAlab-NTNU.git**).
5) Create a shortcut (Windows) or alias (Mac) of the the "ESCAlab-NTNU" directory and place it in the "Igor Procedures" folder (within Igor, go to Help -> Igor Pro User Files).
6) Boot Igor Pro (version 7 or later) and "ESCAlab" should appear as a dropdown menu inside the program window.

If you install ESCAlab-NTNU this way, all you need to do to maintain an updated version of the code is to use Git/GitHub Desktop to *fetch* the latest master version (all updates will be online and public). This gives you the latest version locally on your host computer.

If you want to suggest any changes or new functionality to the code, I suggest that you:
1) *Fork* the source repository and make a *branch* on your local version of the code.
2) By the time you are done making changes, make sure your branched version of the code is synchronized with the master file.
3) Once your code matches the online master version (plus additional changes you have made), then you can submit a pull request and I will consider merging the changes suggested into the master file.

Enjoy the code!

H.
